# Nuxt UI Pro Dashboard - Free & Open Source Version
This project is a **free and open-source version** of the Nuxt UI Pro Dashboard, carefully adapted for community use. While the original Nuxt UI team has done an incredible job in creating a premium, feature-rich dashboard, this repository offers a more accessible version for developers who are looking for powerful, flexible tools without a price tag.

**Important Note:** Not all features from the paid version can be converted to this free version due to licensing restrictions. However, I have made efforts to ensure that the core functionalities remain intact, providing a strong foundation for any Nuxt project.

## üöÄ Features
Nuxt.js powered for fast performance and modern development.
Responsive and mobile-friendly design.

Feel free to modify the components and layouts to suit your project‚Äôs needs. This open-source version is built to be a starting point, providing you with the flexibility to extend and integrate additional features as required.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
